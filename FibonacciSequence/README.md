# 🔁 FibonacciSequence – Generate Fibonacci Sequence in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that generates and prints a specified number of elements from the Fibonacci sequence.

## 🧾 Features

- Prompts the user to enter how many Fibonacci numbers to display
- Generates the sequence using a `while` loop
- Displays the sequence starting from 0

## 📋 How It Works

1. The user inputs the number of Fibonacci elements to generate.
2. The program initializes the first two numbers (`0` and `1`).
3. In each iteration of the loop:
   - It calculates the next number in the sequence.
   - Prints the result.
   - Updates the values for the next iteration.
4. This continues until the requested count is reached.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)
- Looping with `while`
- Console input/output
- Integer parsing with `Int32.Parse()`

## 💡 Example Input/Output

Fibonacci sequence of n elements:

    7

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
