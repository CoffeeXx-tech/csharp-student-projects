# ➕ SumCalculator – Simple Sum Calculation in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user.

## 🧾 Features

- Prompts the user to enter the number of elements to sum  
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate through user inputs  
- Adds each entered number to a total sum using the `+=` operator  
- Displays the total sum after all inputs are processed  

## 📋 How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter an integer `n` — the number of values they want to sum.  
2. A `for` loop runs from 0 to `n - 1`.  
3. Inside the loop, the user enters each number, which is added to a running total using `+=`.  
4. When all numbers are entered, the program prints the total sum.  

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console Application)  
- Basic arrays and loops  
- Console input/output with `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()`  

## 💡 Example Interaction

Enter the number of elements:
5
Enter the numbers:
1
2
3
4
5
The total sum of elements is: 15
