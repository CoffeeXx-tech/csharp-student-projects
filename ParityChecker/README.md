# 🔢 EvenOddNumbers – Display Even and Odd Numbers from 1 to 50 in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that displays all even and odd numbers from 1 to 50.

## 🧾 Features

- Generates numbers from 1 to 50  
- Uses loops and modulo operator (%) to determine if a number is even or odd  
- Prints all even numbers followed by all odd numbers  

## 📋 How It Works

1. The program creates an array to hold numbers from 1 to 50.  
2. It uses a `for` loop to fill the array.  
3. Two separate loops iterate through the array:  
   - The first prints even numbers (`number % 2 == 0`).  
   - The second prints odd numbers (`number % 2 != 0`).  

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)  
- Arrays and loops  
- Console input/output via `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()`  
- Modulo operator `%` to check parity  

## 💡 Example Output

Even numbers:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50,

Odd numbers:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49,
