# ▭ Rectangle – Draw a Rectangle in the Console Using Asterisks (C#)

This simple C# console application draws a filled rectangle using asterisks (`*`). The user provides the height and width, and the program prints the rectangle to the console accordingly.

## 🧾 Features

- Prompts user to enter height and width of the rectangle
- Uses nested `for` loops to draw a rectangle with asterisks
- Fully filled rectangle printed in the console

## 📋 How It Works

1. The user is asked to input the height and width of the rectangle.
2. The outer loop runs once per row (based on height).
3. The inner loop prints asterisks (`*`) for the width of each row.
4. A newline is printed after each row to move to the next line.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)
- Nested `for` loops
- Console input/output with `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()`

## 💡 Example Output

Height: 4
Width: 6
