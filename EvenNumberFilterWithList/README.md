# ✅ EvenNumberFilterWithList – Filter Even Numbers from User Input in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that asks the user to input five integers and filters out the even ones. The even numbers are then displayed on the screen.

## 🧾 Features

- Prompts the user to enter 5 integer values  
- Uses a `List<int>` to store all user inputs  
- Filters even numbers into a separate list  
- Displays only the even numbers at the end  

## 📋 How It Works

1. The program creates two lists: one for all input numbers, and one for even numbers.  
2. It asks the user to enter 5 integers via `Console.ReadLine()`.  
3. Each number is added to the main list.  
4. If the number is divisible by 2, it’s added to the even numbers list.  
5. After collecting all inputs, it prints the even numbers.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)  
- Lists (`List<int>`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`)  
- Console input/output
