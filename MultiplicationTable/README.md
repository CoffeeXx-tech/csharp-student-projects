# ✖️ MultiplicationTable – Multiplication Table from 1 to 10 in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that displays the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 10 in a tabular format.

## 🧾 Features

- Displays the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 10
- Uses nested `for` loops to iterate through rows and columns
- Calculates products using the multiplication operator `*`
- Prints results in a formatted table

## 📋 How It Works

1. The outer `for` loop iterates through numbers 1 to 10 (rows).
2. The inner `for` loop iterates through numbers 2 to 10 (columns).
3. Each product `i * j` is calculated and printed on the same line.
4. After each row, a newline is printed to start the next row.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)
- Nested loops (`for`)
- Console output with `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.Write()`
