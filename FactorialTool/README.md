# 🔢 Factorial – Calculate the Factorial of a Number in C#

This is a simple console application written in C# that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.

## 🧾 Features

- Prompts the user to enter any non-negative integer
- Calculates the factorial using a `for` loop
- Outputs the result to the console

## 📋 How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input a number via `Console.ReadLine()`.
2. A `for` loop runs from 1 to the entered number.
3. Each iteration multiplies the current result by the loop index.
4. The final result (the factorial) is displayed on the screen.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- C# (.NET Console App)
- Integer parsing with `Int32.Parse()`
- Looping with `for`
- Console input/output

## 💡 Example Input/Output

    5

Result: 120
