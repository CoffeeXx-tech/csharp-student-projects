# Project Descriptions

## 1. Simple Login System

### Requirements

- Prompt the user to enter a username and a password.
- Check that:
  - The username is at least 5 characters long.
  - The password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one digit.
- If both conditions are met, display the message: "Logowanie zako≈Ñczone sukcesem" ("Login successful").
- If any condition is not met, display an appropriate error message and prompt the user to re-enter the data.
- The user has a maximum of 3 attempts.

### Description

This program simulates a simple login system that validates user credentials based on specified rules.  
It ensures the username and password meet length and complexity requirements. The user receives feedback on errors and has up to three chances to enter correct data.

### How it works

- The program reads username and password input from the console.
- Validates input according to the rules.
- Repeats the prompt up to three times if input is invalid.
- Prints a success message when validation passes or ends after 3 failed attempts.
